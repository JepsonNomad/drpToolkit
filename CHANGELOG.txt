CHANGELOG

2 March 2022

Issues:

1. In align.py -> estimateTransform(), alignment fails under transModel = Affine because 
   cv.perspectiveTransform() will not return a set of coordinate pairs if h is a 2x3 
   matrix. This results in an error on Line 75 (but the origin of the problem is Line 71)
2. In align.py -> generateTransformTable(), calculating the determinant of the 
   transformation matrix fails under transModel = Affine because you can't take the
   determinant of a non-square matrix.
3. In the align.py argument summarizeTransformError, Python is somewhat unintuitive
   about its use of boolean inputs. Impossible to turn off the summarize step right now
   because command line arguments are stored as strings and "False" is True.

Solutions:

1. Add an if/else to estimateTransform() -> summarizeTransformError() wherein the 
   reprojected points from newImg (i.e. y which comes from points1) are generated
   using cv.perspectiveTransform() when transModel = Homography but using
   cv.transform() when transModel = Affine.
2. Add an if/else statement in generateTransformTable() wherein the top-left 2x2
   subset of the transformation matrix is retained for determinant calculation if
   transModel = Affine; use the full 3x3 matrix if transModel = Homography.
3. Revise the default to false, and then action to 'store_true' so that when the
   -s flag is included, transformError is summarized, and without the -s flag no 
   transform error is included.
